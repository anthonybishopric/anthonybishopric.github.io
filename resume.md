## Overview
I am a versatile engineering lead, capable of working on a wide array of technical and human projects. I want to build a team that fundamentally improves the world we live in. 

## Experience

### Square Inc.
**Staff Software Engineer, March 2014 - August 2019**

* Designed and built a team of 5 engineers to rethink the Square settlement system to be more scalable and secure. Project required two years of disciplined engineering, management and cross-team collaboration. I gave a [presentation at Uber's MoneyCon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_Pt_i3ntGw) describing this system. 
* Launched the [Square Card](https://squareup.com/us/en/business-debit-card) in February 2019, establishing scalability and quality practices that saw the product go from zero to $100M in customer card expenses. Provided leadership during outages for the team and coordinated incident response.
* Interviewed over 300 engineering candidates on behalf of Square, while advising on hiring requirements and the internal engineering promotion process.
* Led team of 7 engineers building Square's service deployment system, [P2](https://github.com/square/p2). This project has enabled new deployment workflows at Square that have saved thousands of engineering hours in productivity and created significant operational agility.
* Architected and built components which were continuously delivered to engineering stakeholders and iterated on feedback from the engineering organization, consisting of 200 developers and 500+ web services with varied and complex needs.
* Balanced thoughtful longterm planning with continuous delivery to keep the project on track while getting constant exposure to customers to ensure needs are being met.
* Designed and wrote integration libraries for Java, Go, Ruby, Coffeescript, Python and Bash to integrate with P2 primitives.
* Mentored and and acted as de-facto manager for the deployment team, growing it from 2 to 7 engineers.
* Presented and trained engineers with several engineering-wide presentations, tutorials and authoritative documentation.
* Led several task forces, including human-friendly access control for Square's internal LDAP, a structured API for web service metadata ("Has this service performed its annual disaster recovery plan?"), and application secrets management.


### Box Inc.
**Staff Software Engineer, July 2011 - March 2014**

* Executed major overhaul of PHP application testing strategy, focusing on modern best practices (unit testing, TDD, testability, CI systems), built several frameworks to make the testing process easier, and ran organization-wide "quality education group" to spread best practices on an ongoing basis.
* Built and maintained feature flagging rollout framework used by all engineers at Box.
* Executed and oversaw dependencies of migration from box.net to box.com. 
* Designed and built components of the next generation of Box's desktop sync application, advised on software architecture/design in Python.
* Promoted twice for recognition of wide-ranging impact and consideration for engineering needs.

### SunRun Inc.
**Lead Developer, March 2008 - February 2011**

* Senior software engineer, first developer at rapidly expanding company with a "solar 2.0" concept. 
* Created a billing and invoicing system for power purchase agreements and leases that currently tracks and is responsible for millions of dollars in revenue using Hibernate and Spring Framework.
* Created a powerful and versatile dependency calculator used as a pricing engine, which has quoted billions of dollars in solar equipment.
* Created data analysis tools to ensure the performance and stability of the residential solar fleet.
* Grew the engineering group from one developer to 15 developers, maintaining engineering best practices throughout, including sprint planning and agile methodologies.
* Wrote integrations for many third party products, including payment processors, a sales-tax database, Salesforce, SpringCM, remote metering providers, address verification services, and many third party solar installation partners to name a few.
* Guided product design efforts to create a CMS platform for sales document design that allows SunRun's sales team to deploy quickly to many markets.

### Shoeboxed.com
**Technical Founder, February 2007 - February 2008**

* Developed website with Spring Framework and Hibernate while leading a team of 7 part-time and full-time programmers. 
* Established high standards of object-orientation and agile programming. Dedicated the summer of 2007 and the following semester to firmly establish the product's technical underpinnings, provided a sophisticated feature set and managed heavy site use.
