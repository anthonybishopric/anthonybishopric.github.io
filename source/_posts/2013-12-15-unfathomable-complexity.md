title: Unfathomable Complexity

The tech community has now lived with powerful RESTful frameworks for a while. The maturity of these tools, as well as a growing ecosystem of programmers, has blown out the entire CRUD application ecosystem. Any concise noun you can think of has an `/endpoint` somewhere. 

It's highly unlikely today that there are any ideas that haven't been explored via the pure CRUD application approach. Gone are the days when you could create a social network that connected demographics X and Y. When was the last time you heard of an exciting startup that didn't have some secret sauce to it? All the good ideas now are ones that employ solutions to low-leverage activities. Airbnb's success is non-trivially related to the founders [letting their own rooms out for a while in the beginning](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9525267/Airbnb-The-story-behind-the-1.3bn-room-letting-website.html). 

I think most people concluded this long ago. Now the interesting question is - how long can software engineering sustain the CRUD app + secret sauce model? How long until we're only worried about building [Adjustment Bureaus and not Athenas](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/12/01/algorithmic-governance-and-the-ghost-in-the-machine/)?

 Page rank started as an innocent algorithm with an incredibly simple CRUD interface. Had humans and capitalism never got involved, it might have stayed that way. Sam Bhagwat discusses the rise of a bureaucratic system overflowing with complexity: 

 > Since its inception, Google has ranked sites by the number of links pointing to them. SEOrs exploited this by buying links all over the Internet to their sites. So Google’s Aug. 2012 update, Penguin, penalized sites pursuing this behavior. In response, devious minds invented ‘negative SEO’:  producing spammy links to a site’s competitors, falsely triggering a penalty.

 There are potential parallels in many domains. Amazon is out delivering groceries to peoples' doorsteps; it has the capacity to hugely alter the way we organize our communities. How will the neighborhood look if you don't need a grocery store? A whole new set of forces come into play, like proximity to distribution centers, institutionalized focus on foods that can survive the extra time in a truck, what it means to have a competitive looking tomato, etc.

 This is different than historic shifts - software is designed to outpace human thought. The future is one that humans could never understand on their own. What's the likelihood that you or anyone could come up with a CRUD application in a 6 hackathon code orgy that actually changes anything? If it's hard now, what about in 10 or 20 years, when problem domains will be so unfathomably complicated that you can't even come up with the nouns to describe them?
